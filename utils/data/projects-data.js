    name: "Leveraging Sequential Deep Learning Models for Detecting Multitude of Human Action Categories ",
    description:
      "In today’s rapidly advancing world of science and technology, Human Action Recognition (HAR) has gained significant attention for enabling smart decision-making. Our research focuses on applying HAR to address criminal activities using a dataset of 1,275 videos featuring 20 actions, including violent and non-violent behaviors. We developed a pipeline combining YOLO-v8 for background extraction and deep learning models (Conv-LSTM and LRCN) for video classification. The LRCN model achieved the best performance, with 62% accuracy and 60% F1 score for 20 classes, 63% accuracy and 66% F1 score for 17 classes, and 88% accuracy with 87% F1 score for binary classification. This work highlights the potential of HAR in enhancing real-time public safety and intelligent decision-making.",

A regression model then predicts the weight based on these measurements. Multiple models are used for segmentation, keypoint detection, and regression, with MMLab as a key tool for implementation.",

A deconvolutional neural network (De-CNN) handles segmentation, while a CNN counts the leaves. Despite limited training data from the CVPPP-2017 dataset, we achieve strong results with data augmentation, achieving an average mean absolute count difference of 1.62 and a standard deviation of 2.30, outperforming previous methods.",
