    description:
      "Human Action Recognition (HAR) is critical for smart decision-making and public safety. Our study focuses on recognizing actions using a dataset of 1,275 videos featuring 20 actions, including violent and non-violent behaviors. A pipeline combining YOLO-v8 for background extraction and deep learning models (Conv-LSTM and LRCN) was developed. The LRCN model achieved 62% accuracy and 60% F1 score for 20 classes, 63% accuracy and 66% F1 score for 17 classes, and 88% accuracy with 87% F1 score for binary classification. This highlights HAR's potential for enhancing real-time safety systems.",

A regression model then predicts the weight based on these measurements. Multiple models are used for segmentation, keypoint detection, and regression, with MMLab as a key tool for implementation.",
